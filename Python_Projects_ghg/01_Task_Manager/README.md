### **📌 README.md for Task Manager**

```md
# 📝 Task Manager CLI  
A simple **command-line task manager** built in Python that allows users to manage tasks efficiently using an **SQLite database**.

---

## 📌 1. What Can "Task Manager" Do?  
✅ **Add tasks** with a title, due date, priority, and category.  
✅ **List tasks** with filtering by priority, category, or completion status.  
✅ **Sort tasks** by due date or priority.  
✅ **Mark tasks as completed** when finished.  
✅ **Delete tasks** that are no longer needed.  
✅ **Check overdue tasks** to see which ones are past their deadline.  

---

## 📌 2. Code Structure
### 📂 **Project Files & Purpose**  
- `main.py` → **Command-line interface** to interact with the task manager.  
- `tasks.py` → **Functions** for adding, listing, completing, and deleting tasks.  
- `database.py` → **Handles SQLite database** connection and structure.  
- `tests/test_tasks.py` → **Unit tests** to ensure the task manager works correctly.  
- `requirements.txt` → **Dependencies** required to run the project.  
- `README.md` → **Project documentation**.  

### 📂 **Key Functions in `tasks.py`**
- `add_task(title, due_date, priority, category)` → Adds a task with the given attributes.  
- `list_tasks(filter_by, sort)` → Displays tasks with optional filtering and sorting.  
- `complete_task(task_id)` → Marks a task as completed.  
- `delete_task(task_id)` → Removes a task from the database.  
- `list_overdue_tasks()` → Lists all tasks that have passed their due date.

## 📌 3. Common Commands  
Here are some useful commands to **interact with the Task Manager**:

### ✅ **Add a New Task**
```bash
python Python_Projects/Task_Manager/main.py add "Complete project report" --due 2024-04-01 --priority High --category Work
```
✅ **Expected Output:**
```
Task 'Complete project report' added successfully with priority High and due date 2024-04-01.
```

### ✅ **List All Tasks**
```bash
python Python_Projects/Task_Manager/main.py list
```

📋 Task List:
1. [High] Complete project report - Work (Due: 2024-04-01) ❌ Pending
```

### ✅ **List Only Completed Tasks**
```bash
python Python_Projects/Task_Manager/main.py list --filter completed
```

### ✅ **Sort Tasks by Due Date**
